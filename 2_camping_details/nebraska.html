The topography ranges from flat to gently rolling hills with large drainages on the north and west boundaries containing relatively steep slopes and creeks that flow toward the Bad River and the Missouri River.&nbsp;The Grassland has numerous intermittent drainages that have been dammed to create small to medium-sized ponds that provide water for wildlife and livestock.&nbsp;Many of these ponds have become important for waterfowl habitat and popular fisheries.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Fort Pierre National Grassland is widely known for its mixed grass prairie vegetation that provides shelter to the Greater Prairie Chicken, the Sharptail Grouse, the Chinese Ring-neck Pheasant, and numerous migrating birds.&nbsp;Other wildlife species that make their homes on the Grassland include: black-tail prairie dogs, badgers, coyotes, rattlesnakes, burrowing owls, raptors, jack rabbits, mule and whitetail deer, antelope, and various rodents.</p>    <p><strong>Recreation</strong></p>    <p>The Fort Pierre National Grassland offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities from dispersed camping to hunting and fishing.&nbsp;With the north boundary of the Grassland being located&nbsp;approximately 8 miles south of Pierre, South Dakota; visitors have the choice of dispersed camping or sleeping in nearby accommodations.&nbsp;There are two undeveloped campgrounds that have large dams for fishing: Richland Dam and Sheriff Dam.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All motorized vehicle travel is restricted to designated&nbsp;routes on a year-around basis.&nbsp;Our office has free copies of the <a href="/detail/nebraska/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5097502">Motor Vehicle Use Map</a>, which&nbsp;show national forest system roads open to motorized travel as well as seasonal designations.</p>    <p>During the spring and summer months, the Fort Pierre National Grassland comes to life with wildflowers, waving grasses, and an abundance of wildlife in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;The Grassland is a great place to birdwatch, fish, disperse camp, and just enjoy the Great Plains.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>    <p>Things to be mindful of while recreating on our Grassland are:&nbsp;insects, snakes, and the weather.&nbsp;The tall grass provides the perfect habitat for ticks, chiggers, and mosquitoes so be sure to have that insect repellant handy!&nbsp;Various species of snakes can be found across the prairie and prairie dog towns are famous for rattlesnake dens so one must pay extra close attention&nbsp;while in those areas.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a href="http://www.weather.gov">Weather</a> on the plains is always changing; the temperatures can range from cool mornings to very hot afternoons with high winds.&nbsp;Be sure to have sunscreen and plenty of water available.

The topography ranges from flat to gently rolling hills with large drainages on the north and west boundaries containing relatively steep slopes and creeks that flow toward the Bad River and the Missouri River.&nbsp;The Grassland has numerous intermittent drainages that have been dammed to create small to medium-sized ponds that provide water for wildlife and livestock.&nbsp;Many of these ponds have become important for waterfowl habitat and popular fisheries.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Fort Pierre National Grassland is widely known for its mixed grass prairie vegetation that provides shelter to the Greater Prairie Chicken, the Sharptail Grouse, the Chinese Ring-neck Pheasant, and numerous migrating birds.&nbsp;Other wildlife species that make their homes on the Grassland include: black-tail prairie dogs, badgers, coyotes, rattlesnakes, burrowing owls, raptors, jack rabbits, mule and whitetail deer, antelope, and various rodents.</p>    <p><strong>Recreation</strong></p>    <p>The Fort Pierre National Grassland offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities from dispersed camping to hunting and fishing.&nbsp;With the north boundary of the Grassland being located&nbsp;approximately 8 miles south of Pierre, South Dakota; visitors have the choice of dispersed camping or sleeping in nearby accommodations.&nbsp;There are two undeveloped campgrounds that have large dams for fishing: Richland Dam and Sheriff Dam.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All motorized vehicle travel is restricted to designated&nbsp;routes on a year-around basis.&nbsp;Our office has free copies of the <a href="/detail/nebraska/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5097502">Motor Vehicle Use Map</a>, which&nbsp;show national forest system roads open to motorized travel as well as seasonal designations.</p>    <p>During the spring and summer months, the Fort Pierre National Grassland comes to life with wildflowers, waving grasses, and an abundance of wildlife in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;The Grassland is a great place to birdwatch, fish, disperse camp, and just enjoy the Great Plains.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>    <p>Things to be mindful of while recreating on our Grassland are:&nbsp;insects, snakes, and the weather.&nbsp;The tall grass provides the perfect habitat for ticks, chiggers, and mosquitoes so be sure to have that insect repellant handy!&nbsp;Various species of snakes can be found across the prairie and prairie dog towns are famous for rattlesnake dens so one must pay extra close attention&nbsp;while in those areas.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a href="http://www.weather.gov">Weather</a> on the plains is always changing; the temperatures can range from cool mornings to very hot afternoons with high winds.&nbsp;Be sure to have sunscreen and plenty of water available.

The topography ranges from flat to gently rolling hills with large drainages on the north and west boundaries containing relatively steep slopes and creeks that flow toward the Bad River and the Missouri River.&nbsp;The Grassland has numerous intermittent drainages that have been dammed to create small to medium-sized ponds that provide water for wildlife and livestock.&nbsp;Many of these ponds have become important for waterfowl habitat and popular fisheries.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Fort Pierre National Grassland is widely known for its mixed grass prairie vegetation that provides shelter to the Greater Prairie Chicken, the Sharptail Grouse, the Chinese Ring-neck Pheasant, and numerous migrating birds.&nbsp;Other wildlife species that make their homes on the Grassland include: black-tail prairie dogs, badgers, coyotes, rattlesnakes, burrowing owls, raptors, jack rabbits, mule and whitetail deer, antelope, and various rodents.</p>    <p><strong>Recreation</strong></p>    <p>The Fort Pierre National Grassland offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities from dispersed camping to hunting and fishing.&nbsp;With the north boundary of the Grassland being located&nbsp;approximately 8 miles south of Pierre, South Dakota; visitors have the choice of dispersed camping or sleeping in nearby accommodations.&nbsp;There are two undeveloped campgrounds that have large dams for fishing: Richland Dam and Sheriff Dam.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All motorized vehicle travel is restricted to designated&nbsp;routes on a year-around basis.&nbsp;Our office has free copies of the <a href="/detail/nebraska/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5097502">Motor Vehicle Use Map</a>, which&nbsp;show national forest system roads open to motorized travel as well as seasonal designations.</p>    <p>During the spring and summer months, the Fort Pierre National Grassland comes to life with wildflowers, waving grasses, and an abundance of wildlife in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;The Grassland is a great place to birdwatch, fish, disperse camp, and just enjoy the Great Plains.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>    <p>Things to be mindful of while recreating on our Grassland are:&nbsp;insects, snakes, and the weather.&nbsp;The tall grass provides the perfect habitat for ticks, chiggers, and mosquitoes so be sure to have that insect repellant handy!&nbsp;Various species of snakes can be found across the prairie and prairie dog towns are famous for rattlesnake dens so one must pay extra close attention&nbsp;while in those areas.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a href="http://www.weather.gov">Weather</a> on the plains is always changing; the temperatures can range from cool mornings to very hot afternoons with high winds.&nbsp;Be sure to have sunscreen and plenty of water available.

The topography ranges from flat to gently rolling hills with large drainages on the north and west boundaries containing relatively steep slopes and creeks that flow toward the Bad River and the Missouri River.&nbsp;The Grassland has numerous intermittent drainages that have been dammed to create small to medium-sized ponds that provide water for wildlife and livestock.&nbsp;Many of these ponds have become important for waterfowl habitat and popular fisheries.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Fort Pierre National Grassland is widely known for its mixed grass prairie vegetation that provides shelter to the Greater Prairie Chicken, the Sharptail Grouse, the Chinese Ring-neck Pheasant, and numerous migrating birds.&nbsp;Other wildlife species that make their homes on the Grassland include: black-tail prairie dogs, badgers, coyotes, rattlesnakes, burrowing owls, raptors, jack rabbits, mule and whitetail deer, antelope, and various rodents.</p>    <p><strong>Recreation</strong></p>    <p>The Fort Pierre National Grassland offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities from dispersed camping to hunting and fishing.&nbsp;With the north boundary of the Grassland being located&nbsp;approximately 8 miles south of Pierre, South Dakota; visitors have the choice of dispersed camping or sleeping in nearby accommodations.&nbsp;There are two undeveloped campgrounds that have large dams for fishing: Richland Dam and Sheriff Dam.&nbsp;</p>    <p>All motorized vehicle travel is restricted to designated&nbsp;routes on a year-around basis.&nbsp;Our office has free copies of the <a href="/detail/nebraska/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5097502">Motor Vehicle Use Map</a>, which&nbsp;show national forest system roads open to motorized travel as well as seasonal designations.</p>    <p>During the spring and summer months, the Fort Pierre National Grassland comes to life with wildflowers, waving grasses, and an abundance of wildlife in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp;The Grassland is a great place to birdwatch, fish, disperse camp, and just enjoy the Great Plains.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>    <p>Things to be mindful of while recreating on our Grassland are:&nbsp;insects, snakes, and the weather.&nbsp;The tall grass provides the perfect habitat for ticks, chiggers, and mosquitoes so be sure to have that insect repellant handy!&nbsp;Various species of snakes can be found across the prairie and prairie dog towns are famous for rattlesnake dens so one must pay extra close attention&nbsp;while in those areas.&nbsp;</p>    <p><a href="http://www.weather.gov">Weather</a> on the plains is always changing; the temperatures can range from cool mornings to very hot afternoons with high winds.&nbsp;Be sure to have sunscreen and plenty of water available.
