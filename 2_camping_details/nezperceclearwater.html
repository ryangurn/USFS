They followed the Lolo Trail, an ancient travel route of the Nez Perce Indians. One of the responsibilities given to Lewis and Clark before their epic journey west was to study the flora and fauna of the United States&#39; newly acquired land. They collected hundreds of plant specimens with approximately 170 being new to science. As a tribute to their efforts, several species are named for them.</p>  <p>  	The Nez Perce-Clearwater and Lolo National Forests manage the areas of the Lolo Trail National Historic Landmark. This landmark coincides with a portion of the Lewis and Clark and the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trails.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail</h3>  <p>  	Tracing the courses of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail stretches through 11 states - Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The Trail winds over mountains, along rivers, through plains and high deserts, and extends to the wave-lapped Pacific coast. In this diversity of landscapes, visitors to the Trail create their own journeys of discovery.

The Nez Perce (Nim&iacute;ipuu or Nee-Me-Poo) National Historic Trail stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, to the Bear Paw Battlefield near Chinook, MT. It was added to this system by Congress as a National Historic Trail in 1986.

It&nbsp;is the site of many historic events and carries the memories of hundreds of years of American Indian use. Lewis &amp; Clark followed&nbsp;this route on their trip across the mountains to the west coast.&nbsp; Read <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5401818.pdf">Lewis and Clark on the Lolo Trail</a> (787 kb pdf) - for more history and recreation information.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lolo Motorway</h3>  <p>  	Forest Road 500, known as The Lolo Motorway, is a primitive, winding road built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. A low standard road, it generally parallels trails along the high ridges that form the divide between the Lochsa and North Fork Clearwater Rivers. Despite the name &quot;Motorway,&quot; this road is very rough, narrow and travels through remote country. The safety of visitors is a major concern. Access to the Lolo Motorway in the Powell area is via FS Road 569 (Parachute Hill Road), and in the Wilderness Gateway area via FS Road 107 (Saddle Camp Road). Access to Forest Road 100 in the Kamiah area is at the junction of U.S. Highway 12 and the Kamiah bridge over the Clearwater River. The Lolo Motorway is a difficult trip that demands a high degree of self-sufficiency and the right vehicle.</p>  <p>  	Before embarking on a trip along this route, we suggest you review our regularly updated <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road Reports</a> or contact your local <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nezperceclearwater/about-forest/offices">Forest office</a>.</p></div>    </li>

The western boundary is formed by the Snake River, popularly known as &quot;Hells Canyon&quot; - the deepest gorge in North America. The Salmon River - often referred to as &quot;The River of No Return&quot; - forms the southern border before turning to the north and forming a central corridor to the Salmon River District.</p>    <p>The Salmon River District covers 449,309 acres (91,057 wilderness) of land. The highest point on the Forest, He Devil Peak, at 9,393 feet and lowest point at Jones Creek at Pittsburg Landing on the Snake River at 2,050 feet, are both in the District. The Clearwater Ranger District, within the Corridor, is the most accessible of the forest&#39;s districts. The entire northwest side of the district is the forest boundary bordering the Camas Prairie, a short distance from Grangeville. The district area encompasses approximately 220,000 acres. Initial access across the district was provided by the Nez Perce Trail, a primary Indian route between the Bitterroot and Clearwater valleys. The Milner Toll Road between Mount Idaho and Florence, was constructed around 1893. The toll road, now called Milner Trail, is a popular ATV trail.</p>    <p><a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055692.pdf">Learn More about this Corridor</a></p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road and Trail Status Reports</a></p></div>    </li>

They followed the Lolo Trail, an ancient travel route of the Nez Perce Indians. One of the responsibilities given to Lewis and Clark before their epic journey west was to study the flora and fauna of the United States&#39; newly acquired land. They collected hundreds of plant specimens with approximately 170 being new to science. As a tribute to their efforts, several species are named for them.</p>  <p>  	The Nez Perce-Clearwater and Lolo National Forests manage the areas of the Lolo Trail National Historic Landmark. This landmark coincides with a portion of the Lewis and Clark and the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trails.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail</h3>  <p>  	Tracing the courses of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail stretches through 11 states - Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The Trail winds over mountains, along rivers, through plains and high deserts, and extends to the wave-lapped Pacific coast. In this diversity of landscapes, visitors to the Trail create their own journeys of discovery. Read more at the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm">Lewis and Clark NHT</a> website.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail</h3>  <p>  	Congress passed the National Trails System Act in 1968, establishing a framework for a nationwide system of scenic, recreational, and historic trails. The Nez Perce (Nim&iacute;ipuu or Nee-Me-Poo) National Historic Trail stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, to the Bear Paw Battlefield near Chinook, MT. It was added to this system by Congress as a National Historic Trail in 1986.

It&nbsp;is the site of many historic events and carries the memories of hundreds of years of American Indian use. Lewis &amp; Clark followed&nbsp;this route on their trip across the mountains to the west coast.&nbsp; Read <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5401818.pdf">Lewis and Clark on the Lolo Trail</a> (787 kb pdf) - for more history and recreation information.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lolo Motorway</h3>  <p>  	Forest Road 500, known as The Lolo Motorway, is a primitive, winding road built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. A low standard road, it generally parallels trails along the high ridges that form the divide between the Lochsa and North Fork Clearwater Rivers. Despite the name &quot;Motorway,&quot; this road is very rough, narrow and travels through remote country. The safety of visitors is a major concern. Access to the Lolo Motorway in the Powell area is via FS Road 569 (Parachute Hill Road), and in the Wilderness Gateway area via FS Road 107 (Saddle Camp Road). Access to Forest Road 100 in the Kamiah area is at the junction of U.S. Highway 12 and the Kamiah bridge over the Clearwater River. The Lolo Motorway is a difficult trip that demands a high degree of self-sufficiency and the right vehicle.</p>  <p>  	Before embarking on a trip along this route, we suggest you review our regularly updated <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road Reports</a> or contact your local <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nezperceclearwater/about-forest/offices">Forest office</a>.</p></div>    </li>

The corridor was created in 1980 leaving a unique road that enables a traveler to drive between two wildernesses: the 1.2 million-acre Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness to the north, and the 2.3-million-acre Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness to the South. The road itself has changed little since its construction by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s.</p>  <p>  	Travel time varies, but it takes six to eight hours to travel from Red River to Darby without rest stops, at an average speed of 12-15 miles per hour. A two-day trip is ideal with an overnight stay at one of the dispersed or primitive campsite locations. The corridor was named for Elk City merchant Lloyd Magruder who, in 1863, along with four companions, was murdered near mile 44.2 westbound (near the Selway River). The murderers were pursued and brought back to Lewiston, Idaho, where they were tried, found guilty, and hanged; the first legal hanging in the Idaho territory.</p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055693.pdf">Learn more about this corridor</a></p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5158968.pdf">Road and trail status report</a></p></div>    </li>

The western boundary is formed by the Snake River, popularly known as &quot;Hells Canyon&quot; - the deepest gorge in North America. The Salmon River - often referred to as &quot;The River of No Return&quot; - forms the southern border before turning to the north and forming a central corridor to the Salmon River District.</p>    <p>The Salmon River District covers 449,309 acres (91,057 wilderness) of land. The highest point on the Forest, He Devil Peak, at 9,393 feet and lowest point at Jones Creek at Pittsburg Landing on the Snake River at 2,050 feet, are both in the District. The Clearwater Ranger District, within the Corridor, is the most accessible of the forest&#39;s districts. The entire northwest side of the district is the forest boundary bordering the Camas Prairie, a short distance from Grangeville. The district area encompasses approximately 220,000 acres. Initial access across the district was provided by the Nez Perce Trail, a primary Indian route between the Bitterroot and Clearwater valleys. The Milner Toll Road between Mount Idaho and Florence, was constructed around 1893. The toll road, now called Milner Trail, is a popular ATV trail.</p>    <p><a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055692.pdf">Learn More about this Corridor</a></p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road and Trail Status Reports</a></p></div>    </li>

They followed the Lolo Trail, an ancient travel route of the Nez Perce Indians. One of the responsibilities given to Lewis and Clark before their epic journey west was to study the flora and fauna of the United States&#39; newly acquired land. They collected hundreds of plant specimens with approximately 170 being new to science. As a tribute to their efforts, several species are named for them.</p>  <p>  	The Nez Perce-Clearwater and Lolo National Forests manage the areas of the Lolo Trail National Historic Landmark. This landmark coincides with a portion of the Lewis and Clark and the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trails.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail</h3>  <p>  	Tracing the courses of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail stretches through 11 states - Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The Trail winds over mountains, along rivers, through plains and high deserts, and extends to the wave-lapped Pacific coast. In this diversity of landscapes, visitors to the Trail create their own journeys of discovery. Read more at the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm">Lewis and Clark NHT</a> website.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail</h3>  <p>  	Congress passed the National Trails System Act in 1968, establishing a framework for a nationwide system of scenic, recreational, and historic trails. The Nez Perce (Nim&iacute;ipuu or Nee-Me-Poo) National Historic Trail stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, to the Bear Paw Battlefield near Chinook, MT. It was added to this system by Congress as a National Historic Trail in 1986.

It&nbsp;is the site of many historic events and carries the memories of hundreds of years of American Indian use. Lewis &amp; Clark followed&nbsp;this route on their trip across the mountains to the west coast.&nbsp; Read <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5401818.pdf">Lewis and Clark on the Lolo Trail</a> (787 kb pdf) - for more history and recreation information.</p>  <p>  	&nbsp;</p>  <h3>  	Lolo Motorway</h3>  <p>  	Forest Road 500, known as The Lolo Motorway, is a primitive, winding road built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. A low standard road, it generally parallels trails along the high ridges that form the divide between the Lochsa and North Fork Clearwater Rivers. Despite the name &quot;Motorway,&quot; this road is very rough, narrow and travels through remote country. The safety of visitors is a major concern. Access to the Lolo Motorway in the Powell area is via FS Road 569 (Parachute Hill Road), and in the Wilderness Gateway area via FS Road 107 (Saddle Camp Road). Access to Forest Road 100 in the Kamiah area is at the junction of U.S. Highway 12 and the Kamiah bridge over the Clearwater River. The Lolo Motorway is a difficult trip that demands a high degree of self-sufficiency and the right vehicle.</p>  <p>  	Before embarking on a trip along this route, we suggest you review our regularly updated <a href="http://prdp2fs.ess.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road Reports</a> or contact your local <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nezperceclearwater/about-forest/offices">Forest office</a>.</p></div>    </li>

The corridor was created in 1980 leaving a unique road that enables a traveler to drive between two wildernesses: the 1.2 million-acre Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness to the north, and the 2.3-million-acre Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness to the South. The road itself has changed little since its construction by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s.</p>  <p>  	Travel time varies, but it takes six to eight hours to travel from Red River to Darby without rest stops, at an average speed of 12-15 miles per hour. A two-day trip is ideal with an overnight stay at one of the dispersed or primitive campsite locations. The corridor was named for Elk City merchant Lloyd Magruder who, in 1863, along with four companions, was murdered near mile 44.2 westbound (near the Selway River). The murderers were pursued and brought back to Lewiston, Idaho, where they were tried, found guilty, and hanged; the first legal hanging in the Idaho territory.</p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055693.pdf">Learn more about this corridor</a></p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5158968.pdf">Road and trail status report</a></p></div>    </li>

The western boundary is formed by the Snake River, popularly known as &quot;Hells Canyon&quot; - the deepest gorge in North America. The Salmon River - often referred to as &quot;The River of No Return&quot; - forms the southern border before turning to the north and forming a central corridor to the Salmon River District.</p>    <p>The Salmon River District covers 449,309 acres (91,057 wilderness) of land. The highest point on the Forest, He Devil Peak, at 9,393 feet and lowest point at Jones Creek at Pittsburg Landing on the Snake River at 2,050 feet, are both in the District. The Clearwater Ranger District, within the Corridor, is the most accessible of the forest&#39;s districts. The entire northwest side of the district is the forest boundary bordering the Camas Prairie, a short distance from Grangeville. The district area encompasses approximately 220,000 acres. Initial access across the district was provided by the Nez Perce Trail, a primary Indian route between the Bitterroot and Clearwater valleys. The Milner Toll Road between Mount Idaho and Florence, was constructed around 1893. The toll road, now called Milner Trail, is a popular ATV trail.</p>    <p><a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055692.pdf">Learn More about this Corridor</a></p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road and Trail Status Reports</a></p></div>    </li>

The western boundary is formed by the Snake River, popularly known as &quot;Hells Canyon&quot; - the deepest gorge in North America. The Salmon River - often referred to as &quot;The River of No Return&quot; - forms the southern border before turning to the north and forming a central corridor to the Salmon River District.</p>    <p>The Salmon River District covers 449,309 acres (91,057 wilderness) of land. The highest point on the Forest, He Devil Peak, at 9,393 feet and lowest point at Jones Creek at Pittsburg Landing on the Snake River at 2,050 feet, are both in the District. The Clearwater Ranger District, within the Corridor, is the most accessible of the forest&#39;s districts. The entire northwest side of the district is the forest boundary bordering the Camas Prairie, a short distance from Grangeville. The district area encompasses approximately 220,000 acres. Initial access across the district was provided by the Nez Perce Trail, a primary Indian route between the Bitterroot and Clearwater valleys. The Milner Toll Road between Mount Idaho and Florence, was constructed around 1893. The toll road, now called Milner Trail, is a popular ATV trail.</p>    <p><a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055692.pdf">Learn More about this Corridor</a></p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/nezperceclearwater/alerts-notices">Road and Trail Status Reports</a></p></div>    </li>

The route, known as the southern Nez Perce Trail, was later used by gold miners and homesteaders who flocked to the area in the 1860s.</p>  <p>  	Today, State Highway 14, which follows the South Fork of the Clearwater River, is the primary travel route through the corridor. This picturesque route winds through the forested canyon with sections of rugged granite outcroppings. From Golden, the countryside changes to gently sloping lodgepole pine-covered uplands and lush meadows which are carpeted with a variety of wildflowers from April through July. An auto tour along the historic Elk City Wagon Road is located in the northern portion of the corridor. Interpretive signs along Highway 14 explain the rich and colorful mining history of the Elk City/Dixie area. The Newsome and Orogrande mining districts can be accessed from Highway 14. Visitors will find hiking, fishing and picnicking opportunities along the way.</p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm91_055694.pdf">Learn more about this corridor</a></p>  <p>  	<a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5158966.pdf">Road and trail status report</a></p></div>    </li>
