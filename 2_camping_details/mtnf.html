J. Markham, who acquired the property in 1901 and operated a lumber mill at the site until the 1930s.&nbsp;The Fuchs House, a five-bedroom concrete and native stone home, also sits on the property, along with a neighboring mill.</p>    <p>Located adjacent to the Black River, the recreation area contains a small pond that dates back to the 1800s. The area is covered by a dense forest of colorful trees, including ash, elm, maple and poplar. River and stream fishing are popular activities near the campground. The Black River boasts bass, sunfish, walleye and catfish. Many anglers fish from boats, but others fish from the riverbanks. Canoeing and kayaking is also possible on the river.&nbsp;<br />  <br />  <strong>Various day hikes </strong>within the Markham Springs Trail System are accessible from the campground. Eagle Bluff Trail is a 1.5-mile loop along the river, where birding and wildlife viewing are favorite pastimes.</p>    <p>Markham Springs Campground is set on the Black River in a scenic and historic recreation area in the southwestern corner of Missouri&#39;s Mark Twain National Forest. The area provides access to multiple trails and recreational opportunities.&nbsp;The campground offers single and double sites for tent and RV camping. Some rather primitive sites are located in a wooded setting near the river.&nbsp;Electric hookups are provided, as well as tables and campfire rings with grills. Lantern posts are also available. Accessible vault toilets, drinking water, showers and trash collection are provided.</p>    <p><strong>Primitive camping</strong> is also available in a wooded setting near the Black River.</p>    <p><strong>The day use area</strong> has a 2-acre, 20 foot deep mill pond that dates back to the 1800s, several picnic sites, open fields; river access for boating, fishing and float tubes and canoes; and short hiking trails that provide views of the river, the pond, the springs and the uplands.&nbsp; Six springs pour almost 5 million gallons of water a day into the pond, and the bubble spring, a smaller outlet of Markham Spring outside of the pond area that has air with it, rises in soft sand forming the unique &ldquo;air bubbles&rdquo;.</p>    <p>In the late 1930&rsquo;s, Rudolph Fuchs built a 5-bedroom concrete and native stone house for his family, and also built the present wheel house to produce electricity for his needs. Power was obtained by building a dam in a semi-circle below a large spring forming a small pond. The water was to pour through a chute on the wheel to produce electricity; however electricity arrived to the site before the wheel ever needed to do its job. The area had an undershot wheel providing power to a grist mill in the late 19th century.</p>    <p>The historic Fuchs house was restored by a group of craftsmen under permit from the National Forest.&nbsp; Used primarily by these individuals and their families, it is also available for rent by the day, weekend, or week.

It became one of the 8 initial units of the National Wild and Scenic River system in 1968. The Eleven Point River meanders through the picturesque Ozark hills of southern Missouri. Its course is cut in the shadows of steep bluffs, through sloping forested valleys, and low lying riparian ecosystems. Barely more than a small stream at its upper reaches near Thomasville, it gains considerable width and depth as its proceeds south-eastward. Springs pouring from dolomite bluffs or rushing up from a vast network of underground flow systems provide a continuous source of water and beauty. Alternating stretches of rapids and deep clear pools wind around moss covered boulders and shading bottomland hardwood trees.</p>    <p>ACCESS TO THE RIVER: There are currently eleven designated access points to the river by vehicle. Of these access points, 7 are managed to a standard that includes boat ramps and vault toilets. The remaining 4 access sites are managed to a lesser standard to encourage use by those wishing to avoid higher user densities. In addition, there are 8 float camps designated on the river to provide overnight camping for river users.</p>    <p>WHO CAN USE THE RIVER: The river has been designated for both motorized and non-motorized use. The motorized users must adhere to a 25 horsepower limit.</p>    <p>FISHING: There are opportunities aplenty for small mouth bass and pan fish. Special regulations apply. Go to <a href="https://www.mdc.mo.gov/">www.mdc.mo.gov</a> for more information. Trout fishing starts at the confluence of the Greer spring branch and the river. Greer is the world&#39;s 10th biggest spring and doubles the size of the river while turning it into a cold water fishery. This is the beginning of the blue ribbon trout section which extends about 6 miles to Turner Mill spring. Flies and artificial lures only are allowed (soft plastic and baits are prohibited) and there is a limit of 1 fish at least 18 inches. There is a strong population in this section of river.&nbsp;</p>    <p>For Steam Flow and Flooding forecast visit the Quick Link section in the right column or <a href="/detail/mtnf/recreation/?cid=fseprd512630">Click here</a>.</p>    <p>For More Information on floating, camping and access points on the Eleven Point Scenic River <a href="/detailfull/mtnf/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5190747&amp;width=full">Click here</a>.</p></div>    </li>

J. Markham, who acquired the property in 1901 and operated a lumber mill at the site until the 1930s.&nbsp;The Fuchs House, a five-bedroom concrete and native stone home, also sits on the property, along with a neighboring mill.</p>    <p>Located adjacent to the Black River, the recreation area contains a small pond that dates back to the 1800s. The area is covered by a dense forest of colorful trees, including ash, elm, maple and poplar. River and stream fishing are popular activities near the campground. The Black River boasts bass, sunfish, walleye and catfish. Many anglers fish from boats, but others fish from the riverbanks. Canoeing and kayaking is also possible on the river.&nbsp;<br />  <br />  <strong>Various day hikes </strong>within the Markham Springs Trail System are accessible from the campground. Eagle Bluff Trail is a 1.5-mile loop along the river, where birding and wildlife viewing are favorite pastimes.</p>    <p>Markham Springs Campground is set on the Black River in a scenic and historic recreation area in the southwestern corner of Missouri&#39;s Mark Twain National Forest. The area provides access to multiple trails and recreational opportunities.&nbsp;The campground offers single and double sites for tent and RV camping. Some rather primitive sites are located in a wooded setting near the river.&nbsp;Electric hookups are provided, as well as tables and campfire rings with grills. Lantern posts are also available. Accessible vault toilets, drinking water, showers and trash collection are provided.</p>    <p><strong>Primitive camping</strong> is also available in a wooded setting near the Black River.</p>    <p><strong>The day use area</strong> has a 2-acre, 20 foot deep mill pond that dates back to the 1800s, several picnic sites, open fields; river access for boating, fishing and float tubes and canoes; and short hiking trails that provide views of the river, the pond, the springs and the uplands.&nbsp; Six springs pour almost 5 million gallons of water a day into the pond, and the bubble spring, a smaller outlet of Markham Spring outside of the pond area that has air with it, rises in soft sand forming the unique &ldquo;air bubbles&rdquo;.</p>    <p>In the late 1930&rsquo;s, Rudolph Fuchs built a 5-bedroom concrete and native stone house for his family, and also built the present wheel house to produce electricity for his needs. Power was obtained by building a dam in a semi-circle below a large spring forming a small pond. The water was to pour through a chute on the wheel to produce electricity; however electricity arrived to the site before the wheel ever needed to do its job. The area had an undershot wheel providing power to a grist mill in the late 19th century.</p>    <p>The historic Fuchs house was restored by a group of craftsmen under permit from the National Forest.&nbsp; Used primarily by these individuals and their families, it is also available for rent by the day, weekend, or week.
