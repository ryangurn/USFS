From camping on beautiful Hayden and Coeur d&#39;Alene Lakes to wandering by foot, horse, mountain bike, motorcycle, ATV, or snowmobile through backcountry areas on our hundreds of miles of trails, we offer something for everyone. Our rental cabins, Little Guard Lookout perched high on a mountain peak with unlimited vistas and historic Magee Ranger Station nestled beside a stream, allow you to experience rustic Forest Service living at its best.</p></div>    </li>

One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that &quot;Kaniksu&quot; was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the &quot;river pigs&quot;.</p></div>    </li>

It provides an example of multiple-use recreation. It is enjoyed by hikers, stock users, motorcyclists and ATV riders. Elevations range from 2400 feet to over 6000 feet with over six prominent peaks. The topography is steep and dissected. The area is one of the closest and earliest places to open up and lose its snow for people to recreate. Many people plan their Memorial Day weekends here. The 1910 Fire consumed nearly the entire area. The vegetation is a mosaic of extensive brush fields, remnant stands of older trees and 100-year-old lodgepole pine stands. The Big Creek area was railroad logged following the 1910 Fire but evidence of this is essentially unnoticeable. Developments include cabins, lookout remnants and signs of mining activity. Big game hunting is very popular here and Big Creek supports important fisheries. </font></p>    <p><font size="2">Coeur d&#39;Alene Divide Trail #8 </font></p>    <p><font size="2">St. Joe Divide Trail #16</font></p>    <p><font size="2"><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ipnf/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=82525&amp;actid=50">Big Creek Trail #44</a> - Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">East Fork&nbsp;Big Creek Trail #56&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Bronson Meadows Trail #155&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Prince Peak Trail #159&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Daugherty Hill Trail #252&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2"><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ipnf/recreation/ohv/recarea/?recid=82522&amp;actid=93">Lemonade Peak Trail #555</a>&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Pierce Ridge Trail #563&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Cabin Ridge Trail #565</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Elsie Peak Trail #568&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Ames Ridge Trail #570&nbsp;- Cleared Summer 2017</font></p>    <p><font size="2">Mowat Creek Trail #759</font></p></div>    </li>

One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that &quot;Kaniksu&quot; was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the &quot;river pigs&quot;.</p></div>    </li>

One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that &quot;Kaniksu&quot; was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br />  <br />  Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the &quot;river pigs&quot;.</p></div>    </li>
