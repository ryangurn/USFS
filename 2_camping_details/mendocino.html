<li>  		Group camps may save you money depending on the number of people you have and the number of vehicles, recreational vehicles, or boats that need parking.</li>
<li>  		Group camps allow you to eat together as a group and in some cases, have special cooking facilities and garbage bins.</li>
<li>  		Group camps usually have restrooms located nearby for the group that are generally not used by the other campers in the area.</li>
<li>  		Group camps are generally set apart from the family camps so the additional noise created by the group does not bother other people.</li>
<li>  		Group camps are assigned by reservation <strong>only</strong> so you know when you get there that your entire group will be together.</li>

Forest Service employees you are most likely to come in contact with, in campgrounds and recreation areas, are here to protect and maintain all the resources of the National Forest. One of their primary responsibilities is to maintain the recreation values of the Forest and to enhance - whenever possible - your Mendocino National Forest visit.</p>    <p>There are campgrounds on the Mendocino National Forest that use the Pack it In, Pack it Out program for dealing with waste. This means that garbage cans are not provided. Campers and hikers are asked to bring their own garbage bags and take their garbage with them when leaving the area. While this seems like an inconvenience, the funds saved are used to provide additional recreational facilities. Do not bury litter; forest animals can smell it and will dig it up.We appreciate your cooperation and assistance in helping to manage, protect and conserve the various resources of this forest.</p>    <p>You must obtain a California Campfire Permit if you plan to build a campfire or use a stove, unless you are in a developed recreation area (campground or picnic area). Permits are available free-of-charge at offices of the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>    <p>Please visit, call, or write one of our Forest Service offices for more information. Unless otherwise indicated, office hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 am - 4:30 pm. Most district offices also maintain weekend hours during the summer months. All forest offices are wheelchair accessible.</p></div>    </li>

This area was first protected in 1931 when it was classified as a primitive area. Further protection was given when this area became part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, created by the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness Act of 1984 added another 2,000 acres to the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness, for a total of about 151,626 acres.</p>    <p>The Wilderness is roughly oval in shape, being about 19 miles long in the north-south direction and 24 miles wide in the east-west direction. The majority of the Wilderness lies in two districts of the Mendocino National Forest (Covelo and Grindstone Ranger Districts). The far northern portion of the Wilderness is in the Yolla Bolly&nbsp;Ranger District of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. To the far west, a part of the Wilderness is in the Mad River Ranger District of the Six Rivers National Forest, and the Bureau of Land Management has a small portion of the Wilderness (also on the western edge).</p>    <p>The lowest point of the Wilderness is along Cottonwood Creek (2,600&#39; elevation). This is just four and a half miles from the highest point, Mount Linn, at an elevation of 8,092 feet. Several other peaks push their way above 7,000 feet and provide fine views (weather and smoke permitting) of Mount Lassen, Mount Shasta, the Trinity Alps, the Kings Range and sometimes the Pacific Ocean.</p></div>    </li>
