Later developed as a road by loggers and members of the CCC, this road was designated a Scenic Byway in 1991. Today`s roadway passes 55 miles through boom-and-bust town sites and abandoned claims, as well as rushing rivers and glacier-clad peaks. Although the tracks are gone and the daily whistle silenced, today`s traveler can still see remnants of times gone by.</p>  <p>  	Discover the Verlot Public Service Center, near the South Fork Stillaguamish River.

Operating seasonally, the center`s employees will help you plan an outing.</p>  <p>  	With snow lingering at Barlow Pass through late spring, driving the entire loop is usually limited to late spring through the fall. The road is paved from Verlot to Barlow Pass and from Darrington to the junction with the White Chuck River Road.

The fall months bring cooler temperatures and lower snow levels, limiting hiking access to the high country. Several side roads are groomed, turning them into a winter playland for snowmobiles and cross-country skiers. During winter months the <a href="http://www.mtbaker.us/1011/">Mt.

Later developed as a road by loggers and members of the CCC, this road was designated a Scenic Byway in 1991. Today`s roadway passes 55 miles through boom-and-bust town sites and abandoned claims, as well as rushing rivers and glacier-clad peaks. Although the tracks are gone and the daily whistle silenced, today`s traveler can still see remnants of times gone by.</p>  <p>  	Discover the Verlot Public Service Center, near the South Fork Stillaguamish River. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1933 to 1942, Verlot`s handsome buildings reflect the architectural style and fine craftsmanship of that era and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Operating seasonally, the center`s employees will help you plan an outing.</p>  <p>  	With snow lingering at Barlow Pass through late spring, driving the entire loop is usually limited to late spring through the fall. The road is paved from Verlot to Barlow Pass and from Darrington to the junction with the White Chuck River Road.

This paved road starts at the Interstate 5 interchange in Bellingham, Wash., winds along the scenic North Fork Nooksack River, and climbs to an elevation of 5,140 feet to its well-named destination, Artist Point. This area is legendary for its spectacular views of Mt. Baker and Mt. Shuksan.

The forest byway begins just east of the town of Glacier as the route enters the national forest, leading travelers to historic Heather Meadows, home of the Mt. Baker Ski Area. Forest roads lead off the main highway into the heart of the national forest with trails accessing the Mt. Baker Wilderness and North Cascades National Park backcountry..</p>  <p>  	<strong>Four Seasons of Recreation</strong><br />  	During summer months, Mt. Baker&#39;s 10,781 foot snow-covered peak rises above the landscape. On a clear day, several vantage points offer spectacular views of neighboring Mt. Shuksan and surrounding slopes of the Cascade Mountain range. Hikers can head out on more than 200 miles of trails and campers can enjoy long evenings in rustic settings. The fall months bring cooler temperatures and lower snow levels, limiting hiking access to the high country. Several side roads are groomed, turning them into a winter playland for snowmobiles and cross-country skiers. During winter months the <a href="http://www.mtbaker.us/1011/">Mt.

Glistening lakes nestle between knolls. Ridges bristle with 900-year-old mountain hemlock. Lava flows from Mount Baker have resisted glacial carving and columns of basalt stand like black anvils against the sky.
