<li><strong><a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/florida/home/?cid=FSBDEV3_008653">Be Bear Aware</a>.</strong> Bears call the National Forests in Florida home, so camp accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Waste.</strong>  	<ul>  		<li>Pack it in, pack it out. Dispose of all garbage in proper receptacles.</li>  		<li>Bury all human and pet waste at least 6 inches deep and at least 100 feet away from any water source.</li>  	</ul>  	</li>

<li><strong>Camp Considerately.</strong>  	<ul>  		<li>Dispersed camping is not allowed in the vicinity of developed recreation areas or less than 100 feet from streams and other water sources.</li>  		<li>Pick a previously-used site. Plants, soil and wildlife are impacted by new campsites.</li>  		<li>Make your campsite less visible, so other visitors can experience a “wild” setting.

<li><strong>Control your Campfire.</strong>  	<ul>  		<li>Check if you are in an area with campfire restrictions – these will be listed on Alerts &amp; Notices and Forest Orders.</li>  		<li>Where fires are permitted, minimize the scarring of new rocks, soil, and plants by using existing fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires.</li>  		<li>Down and dead firewood may be gathered around your camping area for use at your campsite. Do not cut standing trees or cut limbs off standing trees.</li>  		<li>Burn all wood and coals down to ashes, and extinguish campfires completely by generously dousing with water and stirring with a shovel. Before leaving your campsite, make certain your campfire is dead out, wet and cold to the touch.</li>  	</ul>  	</li>
