As late as the 1950&#39;s, more than 4,000 sockeye salmon made the annual 900-mile (1,440-km) pilgrimage from the ocean to their spawning grounds in the Sawtooth Valley. However, in recent years only between 2-20 have returned each year. In an effort to save the endangered fish, whose bright red color gave Redfish Lake its name, the National Marine Fisheries Service established a local hatchery. Since 1999, the lake has been stocked with sockeye salmon. Bull trout, steelhead and Chinook salmon can also be spotted in the area. There is a visitor center and Redfish Lake Lodge. Between Little Redfish Lake and Redfish Lake there are commercially operated showers, a gas station with propane, a dump station and horse rentals. Little Redfish Lake does not allow motorboats. Redfish lake campsites that accept reservations include: Sunny Gulch campsite, Glacier View, Outlet campsite, Point, North Shore picnic area and Sunny Gulch Pavillion picnic area.

As late as the 1950&#39;s, more than 4,000 sockeye salmon made the annual 900-mile (1,440-km) pilgrimage from the ocean to their spawning grounds in the Sawtooth Valley. However, in recent years only between 2-20 have returned each year. In an effort to save the endangered fish, whose bright red color gave Redfish Lake its name, the National Marine Fisheries Service established a local hatchery. Since 1999, the lake has been stocked with sockeye salmon. Bull trout, steelhead and Chinook salmon can also be spotted in the area. There is a visitor center and Redfish Lake Lodge. Between Little Redfish Lake and Redfish Lake there are commercially operated showers, a gas station with propane, a dump station and horse rentals. Little Redfish Lake does not allow motorboats. Redfish lake campsites that accept reservations include: Sunny Gulch campsite, Glacier View, Outlet campsite, Point, North Shore picnic area and Sunny Gulch Pavillion picnic area.

Since 1999, the lake has been stocked with sockeye salmon. Bull trout, steelhead and Chinook salmon can also be spotted in the area. There is a visitor center and Redfish Lake Lodge. Between Little Redfish Lake and Redfish Lake there are commercially operated showers, a gas station with propane, a dump station and horse rentals. Little Redfish Lake does not allow motorboats.

However, in recent years only between 2-20 have returned each year. In an effort to save the endangered fish, whose bright red color gave Redfish Lake its name, the National Marine Fisheries Service established a local hatchery.
