The border is shared with the Nicolet National forest. The Iron River Ranger District is 138,000 acres in size.  Recreation opportunities include two camping for fee campgrounds and two rustic campgrounds. Three wilderness areas are located on adjacent districts. The area's climate is truly unique for each season of the year. The weather is summarized as follows: 31 inches of average annual precipitation, 68 inches of snowfall, an average of 62 frost-free days, 59 degree F. average temperature May through September, and long cold winters.<br />  Four-season recreation is Iron County's claim to fame. 2,175 lakes and 902 miles of streams offer unlimited challenges for both warm and cold-water fishing. Three rivers on the district have recently been designated as recreational rivers under the Wild and Scenic rivers Act. Northern hardwoods, pine, balsam fir, and spruce cover 80% of the county. More whitetail deer Boone and Crockett entries have been taken from the forests of Iron County than any other Michigan county. Add to this, the title of woodcock capital of the world and one cannot find any better small and big game hunting anywhere in the Midwest.<br />  When winter arrives, it's no time to rest. 212 miles of snowmobile trails connect to a vast system of trails throughout upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin. The Iron River District, in cooperation with Covenant Point Bible Camp, grooms and maintains a Nordic ski trail, and Ski Brule, a major ski resort, is just minutes from town.</p>  <p><br />  &nbsp;</p></div>    </li>

Stunning views are possible from the eastern rim of the gorge. Except for a few naturally bare slopes, most of the land is forested with pine, hemlock, aspen, sugar maple, birch, and basswood.

Throughout this rugged, steep Wilderness, the Sturgeon and Little Silver Rivers and their tributaries have carved falls, rapids, ponds, oxbows, and terraces. Stunning views are possible from the eastern rim of the gorge. Except for a few naturally bare slopes, most of the land is forested with pine, hemlock, aspen, sugar maple, birch, and basswood. When the leaves of the hardwoods change color in the fall, they form a vivid tapestry. There are few established trails in Sturgeon River Gorge Wilderness, and the few overgrown logging roads are hard to find and follow. The North Country National Scenic Trail parallels the northern and eastern boundaries for about eight miles. Sturgeon River Campground offers&nbsp;seven sites on the southeastern boundary. In spring and during peak runoff, kayaking and white water canoeing are challenging, and only recommended for advanced paddlers.</p>    <p>Sturgeon River Gorge Wilderness <a href="http://go.usa.gov/xNkdf">Map</a></p></div>    </li>

McCormick Wilderness has recovered from the logging era that ended in the early 1900&#39;s. Today, you&#39;ll find a mixture of northern hardwoods and lowland conifers interspersed with small patches of towering white pine, Michigan&#39;s State Tree. Straddling the divide between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, this region ranges from nearly level terrain to rocky cliffs. McCormick&#39;s water is what draws most visitors, with the Huron, Dead, Pahokee, and the Wild and Scenic Yellow Dog Rivers all have part of their headwaters within the wilderness. Many cascading waterfalls on the Yellow Dog make it unnavigable. The Yellow Dog is one of a few Eastern rivers designated &quot;Wild&quot;. Eighteen small lakes add sparkle to the landscape. Trout, pike, and bass live here, but only in small numbers due to the less-than-fertile-waters. The three mile White Lake Trail connects County Road 607 to White Deer Lake where the McCormick Estate once stood. Remnants of old, unmaintained trails can sometimes be found, but the rest of the Wilderness is fairly rugged, isolated, unspoiled, and relatively difficult to access.</p>    <p>McCormick Wilderness <a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3834933.pdf">Map</a></p></div>    </li>
