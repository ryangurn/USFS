<li>Please follow Leave No Trace practices to make sure no evidence of your visit remains.&nbsp; This means packing out all garbage and supplies you brought with you&ndash; leave the site cleaner than when you found it.&nbsp; Where toilets are not provided, bury and cover waste in a shallow trench at least 200 feet away from any water.</li>
<li>Be aware of fire restrictions that apply to campfires outside of developed campsites.&nbsp; In dry conditions, campfires may be banned in the general forest, but still allowed in campgrounds. Never leave a campfire unattended.&nbsp; Be sure your fire is out before you leave the campsite.</li>
<li>Check the most up to date Motorized Vehicle User Map (MVUM) to make sure the Forest Service road you wish to drive on is open to motorized vehicles. Please contact your local Forest Service office to obtain the latest copy of the MVUM map.</li>
<li>Motor vehicles may be parked up to 30 feet from the edge of the road surface when it is safe to do so without causing damage to National Forest&nbsp;resources or facilities, unless prohibited by state law, a traffic sign, or special closure order.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Parking motor vehicles or trailers is not allowed where it will impede traffic, harm vegetation, or impact soils.&nbsp; For example, driving and parking in open fields beyond the shoulder of a road right-of-way.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Parking in front of gates is prohibited.</li>
<li>RV or vehicle campers may utilize shoulder parking pull off areas or closed roads with a berm to park and camp.</li>
<li>Visitors who are tent camping should be a minimum of 150 feet from the edge any trail or Forest Service road.&nbsp; Camp sites must be 200 feet away from any water or lakeshore.</li>
<li>You may not construct any &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; at your camp.&nbsp; Examples of prohibited improvements include digging ditches, cutting of live trees or other vegetation, or construction of permanent fire rings. Disperse all signs of a campfire once it is extinguished, if you use one, or use a camp stove.</li>
<li>You may not leave your camping equipment unattended for more than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Occupancy is limited to 21 days at the same site within a 30 day period, one mile away from previous site.</li>
<li>Be considerate of other campers or users that may be in the area. Hold down the noise please.</li>
