The Snowies display prominent changes in elevation accentuated by surrounding grassland, high plains, and foothill savanna.</p>    <p>The Little Snowy Mountain range has a rich cultural history, beginning with first peoples then homesteading. Today, large ranches maintain the open character of the area. Pine Grove Cemetery continues to be the final resting place for early Euro-American occupants. The Little Snowies are separated from the Big Snowies by a subtle break in topography. It is characterized by foothills that are partially forested with mostly ponderosa pine. In general, the country is semi-arid and dominated by grassy vegetation. Landform is rolling with slopes that are gentle to flat, except where creeks have dissected them. Creeks within the Little Snowies are small and often run dry during the summer months. The major drainages are Willow Creek and the North Fork of Pole Creek, both of which drain south to the Musselshell River.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd500269">More information on the Snowy Mountains</a></p>    <p><a href="/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5435247.pdf">Brochure of hiking opportunities in the Crystal Lake area.</a></p>    <p><strong>Bears may frequent the area; keep all food out of sight in approved containers and remove all food from area after eating.

The northwest corner is a part of the Scapegoat Wilderness and the greater Bob Marshall Wilderness complex.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The landform west of the divide is characterized by mostly rolling hills and mountains that are underlain by various types of rock. High peaks are topped with volcanic rocks with areas of exposed rock. The effects of glaciation are present. The landforms east of the divide are characterized by rounded mountains that are underlain by volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks that have changed through geologic processes. Summits lack much exposed rock and the effects of glaciation are absent. Another characterizing landform that helps define the geographic area is the mountain pass. There are a few notable passes, some allowing for easy automotive travel over the continental divide: Roger, Stemple, Windy, and Flesher.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd500271">More information on the Upper Blackfoot</a></p></div>    </li>

The nearest population center is Helena, Montana. Many smaller communities also have intimate relationships with the geographic area: Montana City, Clancy, Alhambra, Jefferson City, Boulder, Radersburg, Townsend, Winston, and East Helena. The Elkhorns are surrounded by the Divide Mountains and Boulder Batholith on the west, and the Missouri and Boulder River valleys on the north, east, and, south. The form of the Elkhorn Mountains is rounded and furrowed from extensive weathering. High points are prominent from background northwest, west, and southwest perspectives but cryptic from other vantages. Drainages have carved steep gulches and canyons. The majority of the Elkhorns (north, west, southwest) is a part of a batholith. This geologic history has left the area rich in minerals. Evidence of glaciation is localized as boulder strewn areas of granitic rocks. The remaining approximate quarter (southwest) of the geographic area is underlain by sedimentary rock that lacks the same mineralization as the batholith but is rich in calcareous rock. The landforms are rugged, low mountains with hogback ridges and dry valleys.</p>    <p>More information on the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd499905">Elkhorn Mountains</a></p></div>    </li>

High peaks are topped with volcanic rocks with areas of exposed rock. The effects of glaciation are present. The landforms east of the divide are characterized by rounded mountains that are underlain by volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks that have changed through geologic processes. Summits lack much exposed rock and the effects of glaciation are absent. Another characterizing landform that helps define the geographic area is the mountain pass. There are a few notable passes, some allowing for easy automotive travel over the continental divide: Roger, Stemple, Windy, and Flesher.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd500271">More information on the Upper Blackfoot</a></p></div>    </li>

The nearest population center is Helena, Montana. Many smaller communities also have intimate relationships with the geographic area: Montana City, Clancy, Alhambra, Jefferson City, Boulder, Radersburg, Townsend, Winston, and East Helena. The Elkhorns are surrounded by the Divide Mountains and Boulder Batholith on the west, and the Missouri and Boulder River valleys on the north, east, and, south. The form of the Elkhorn Mountains is rounded and furrowed from extensive weathering. High points are prominent from background northwest, west, and southwest perspectives but cryptic from other vantages. Drainages have carved steep gulches and canyons. The majority of the Elkhorns (north, west, southwest) is a part of a batholith. This geologic history has left the area rich in minerals. Evidence of glaciation is localized as boulder strewn areas of granitic rocks. The remaining approximate quarter (southwest) of the geographic area is underlain by sedimentary rock that lacks the same mineralization as the batholith but is rich in calcareous rock. The landforms are rugged, low mountains with hogback ridges and dry valleys.</p>    <p>More information on the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd499905">Elkhorn Mountains</a></p></div>    </li>

The majority of the area is west of the continental divide. The Rocky Mountain Range&nbsp;and Flathead National Forest are directly north and the Divide &nbsp;is to the south. To the east, mountains become grassy foothills with isolated buttes. Montana Highway 200 cuts east-west through the center, crossing over Rogers Pass to follow the Blackfoot River. The northwest corner is a part of the Scapegoat Wilderness and the greater Bob Marshall Wilderness complex.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The landform west of the divide is characterized by mostly rolling hills and mountains that are underlain by various types of rock. High peaks are topped with volcanic rocks with areas of exposed rock. The effects of glaciation are present. The landforms east of the divide are characterized by rounded mountains that are underlain by volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks that have changed through geologic processes. Summits lack much exposed rock and the effects of glaciation are absent. Another characterizing landform that helps define the geographic area is the mountain pass. There are a few notable passes, some allowing for easy automotive travel over the continental divide: Roger, Stemple, Windy, and Flesher.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd500271">More information on the Upper Blackfoot</a></p></div>    </li>
